It is my hope that future generations of brothers, gathering in accord with God’s Will, shall learn and be uplifted by this record of our daily lives in service of the Most High. We are a community with rich history in the area, having been guided by the Lord through the work of many saints such as Eadberht, Aidan, and Cuthbert. It is humbling to know my own meager contributions will be remembered in Heaven among such holy company. This winter was a hard one here on the Holy Island. There were many furious storms and months of heavy snowfall. Our stores held but spirits have been low- yet that has changed with the coming spring. Father Elias is well loved by the brothers for his fair handedness and his breadth of holy knowledge, and he led us well through that valley of darkness. Praise be to God for his presence and the blessings of the saints upon our work here."

Rumors have arrived from the mainland, telling of a cult of pagan demon worshippers corrupting the lands nearby. Brother Jacobus was sent to investigate a few days ago and has not returned. Father Elias has been seldom seen for the last several weeks- he is overseeing a restoration of the ancient catacombs under the sepulcher of Saint Cuthbert. Father has closed off the area to all except a few of his most trusted, and rumors are beginning to spread of what they are doing down there. The sounds of digging and excavation can be heard at all hours. The high and holy mood we experienced in the spring has begun to fade, and without Father’s direct guidance, lapses in holy discipline have begun to spread. I trust Father’s judgment in all things, yet I admit that I have doubts. May the Lord assuage these fears and restore us to the holy community of accord we once knew."
