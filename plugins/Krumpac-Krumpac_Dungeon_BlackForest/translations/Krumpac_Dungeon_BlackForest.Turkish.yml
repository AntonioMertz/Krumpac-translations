Krump_Dung_BlackForest_Lindisfarne_01_LORE_Part1: "In the year of our Lord 792.I, brother Edulfus, do scribe these words as a record of daily life at the Lord’s Monastery in Lindisfarne.It is my hope that future generations of brothers, gathering in accord with God’s Will, shall learn and be uplifted by this record of our daily lives in service of the Most High. We are a community with rich history in the area, having been guided by the Lord through the work of many saints such as Eberth, Aidan, and Cuthbert.It is humbling to know my own meagre contributions will be remembered in Heaven among such holy company.This winter was a hard one here on the Holy Island.There were many furious storms and months of heavy snowfall.Our stores held but spirits have been low- yet that has changed with the coming spring.Father Elias is well loved by the brothers for his fair handedness and his breadth of holy knowledge, and he led us well through that valley of darkness.Praise be to God for his presence and the blessings of the saints upon our work here."
Krump_Dung_BlackForest_Lindisfarne_01_LORE_Part2: "In the few months, since I ended my last entry, things have begun to change here.On the far side of the island, there is a festering marsh and strange noises can be heard from that direction, especially at night.Brother Jacobus was sent to investigate a few days ago and has not returned.I overheard a few of the brothers whispering of cursed spirits in the swamp, yet I give no credence to such blasphemous speculation.Father Elias has been seldom seen for the last several weeks- he is overseeing a restoration of the ancient catacombs under the sepulchre of Saint Cuthbert.Father has closed off the area to all except a few of his most trusted, and rumours are beginning to spread of what they are doing down there.The sounds of digging and excavation can be heard at all hours. The high and holy mood we experienced in the spring has begun to fade, and without Father’s direct guidance, lapses in holy discipline have begun to appear.I trust Father’s judgment in all things, yet I admit that I have doubts.…May the Lord assuage these fears and restore us to the holy community of accord we once knew."
Krump_Dung_BlackForest_Lindisfarne_01_LORE_Part3: "The Holy Day of Saint Ephrem approaches and we are preparing a feast for the influx of pilgrims we have experienced in the last few weeks. It is right and good that we should celebrate such a Saint at this appointed time- his blessings as a healer of wounds are sorely needed here. Father Elias and his inner circle haven’t been seen in several days, and it has fallen to brother Simeon to lead in his absence. Simeon is a good man but I fear he is not up to the task of leading us through these tribulations. To make things worse, the sounds from the swamp have grown louder, and there is no denying that something sinister is moving out there in the dark. Even now, my hands shake at the thought of what could be calling to us from the marshes. I pray that the righteous gathering of our community on this holy day will drive out these evil spirits, and grant us the peace we seek."
Krump_Dung_BlackForest_Lindisfarne_01_LORE_Part4: "It is difficult to describe the events of the day today.As we gathered for morning mass, we could hear chanting from below the sepulchre. At first this did not cause any distress, yet as we listened we discerned strange names amidst the usual benedictions. Brother Simeon must have heard something that troubled him, for he quickly ushered everyone outside for mass in the courtyard- something that has not occurred here in living memory.Even old Brother Roland remarked that it was the strangest mass he’d ever been a part of. Speculation has run amok regarding Father Elias, and a few of my most trusted friends believe he has abandoned the faith and is seeking help from the old pagan gods.I refuse to believe such a thing would be possible. Surely God would not allow such a righteous man to be tempted beyond his ability to stand firm! As I write this, a page from the village has arrived, saying that strange looking ships have been sighted on the eastern horizon.Surely they are travellers from distant lands, here to join us in the feast honouring Saint Cuthbert.We must follow the Saint’s example and show them Godly hospitality."
Krump_Dung_BlackForest_Lindisfarne_01_LORE_Part5: "Dear Lord, preserve us from the fury of these Northman's!A day of blood and death…horrors I have never known and can never describe. These pagan brutes have sacked the town and are despoiling the church as I write this, what will surely be my last entry on my last day. They arrived so suddenly, and killed everyone. Even the women, and my God, the children. Hell has come to Northumbria. We pleaded with Elias to open the catacombs for us to hide there, but he did not answer us. And so I have locked the only entryway and hold the key in my hand. I have managed to avoid detection hiding here in the basement store room, but it is only a matter of time. My God, I can smell smoke. They are setting fire to God’s House!May any who read this avenge me, and my holy brothers. A curse I lay upon these Northman's, may the demons of hell torment them for all eternity…."
